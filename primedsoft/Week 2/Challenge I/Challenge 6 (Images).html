        Nigeria, my country
    </h1>
    <p>
        Nigeria is one of the most densely populated country in Africa with approximately 196 million people in a million km2 area, 
        and is also the country with the largest population in Africa, and is the country with the seventh largest population in the world.

        Approximately 50% of Nigerians are urban dwellers, with the rate of urbanization being estimated at 4.3%. Nigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups,
        with over 500 languages, and the variety of customs, and traditions among them gives the country great cultural diversity. 
        The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa/Fulani 29% of the population; along with the Yoruba 21% and Igbo 19%.
        The Efik, Ibibio, Annang, and Ijaw constitute other Southeastern populations. The Urhobo-Isoko, Edo and Itsekiri constitute Nigerian's Midwest 
        with the Urhobo standing out as the majority.

        Most of the population is a young population, with 42.54% between the ages of 0-14.
        There is also a very high dependency ratio of the country at 88.2 dependents per 100 non-dependents.

        Three of the main religious groups are Muslim at 50%, Christian at 40% and other indigenous beliefs at 10%.
        The predominantly Christian Igbo are found in the southeast[citation needed]. Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination in Igboland, 
        but Anglicanism is also strong, as are Pentecostal and other Evangelical denominations.
        Persons of different ethnic backgrounds most commonly communicate in English, although knowledge of two or more Nigerian languages is widespread.
        Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba are the most widely used Nigerian languages. Nigerian Pidgin is used widely as an unofficial medium of 
        communication especially in the Nigerian cities of Warri, Sapele, Ughelli, Benin and Port Harcourt.

        Population
    </h2>
    <p>
        Nigeria's population has been increasing rapidly for at least the last 5 decades due to very high birth rates, 
        quadrupling its population during this time. That type of growth rate is known as exponential. 
        It is not growing at a linear rate. Growth was fastest in the 1980s, after child mortality had dropped rapidly, 
        and has slowed slightly since then as the birth rate has declined slightly. 
        According to the 2017 revision of the World Population Prospects the total population was 185,989,640 in 2016, 
        compared to only 37,860,000 in 1950. The proportion of children under the age of 15 in 2010 was 44.0%, 53.2% was between 15 and 65 years of age, 
        while 2.7% was 65 years or older. There is a large population momentum, with 3.2 percent growth rate leading to the projected population.

        The Nigerian government has said that it wants to help curb a rapid growth in population. 
        They have offered free contraception over the past 10 years or so and they have even started taking steps to discourage people 
        who are looking to have large families. The government is banking on smaller families as a way to secure financial salvation in the future. 
        They are looking toward territories like Thailand (another country with large population growth issues) as a model for their current strategy.

        Abuja has not successfully implemented family planning programs to reduce and space births because of a lack of political will, 
        government financing, and the availability and affordability of services and products, as well as a cultural preference for large families. 
        Increased educational attainment, especially among women, and improvements in health care are needed to encourage and to better enable parents 
        to opt for smaller families.

        The Nigeria's Chairman of National Population Commission, Eze Duruiheoma, delivering Nigeria’s statement in New York on Sustainable Cities, 
        Human Mobility and International Migration in the 51st Session of Commission on Population and Development, said that “Nigeria remains the most 
        populous in Africa, the seventh globally with an estimated population of over 198 million. The recent World Population Prospects predicts that by 2050, 
        Nigeria will become the third most populated country in the world. Over the last 50 years, the Nigeria’s urban population has grown at an average annual 
        growth rate of more than 6.5 per cent without commensurate increase in social amenities and infrastructure.” He also stated that the population 
        “grew substantially from 17.3 in 1967 to 49.4 per cent in 2017.”
